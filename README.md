Android Software Detonator
==========================

NOTICE! There is not and will not be official Windows port although we try to place all methods using third party API or system calls to tools.rb so porting it won't be as painful.


Program made in Ruby which is helpful at maintaining clear folder structure and speeds up reverse-engineering itself.

This program is licensed under MIT license but in real world I don't give a shit as long as you don't claim my work as yours.

Hence I don't know that much of licensing I won't provide tools this program uses within my program in near future until I find out if authors of those tools will allow it. That's why for unknown time you need to manually place third party software to tools/ -folder. Further help in Installation section.



What ASD provides to you?
- Maintain clear folder structure for your reverse-engineering projects
- Faster way to access most useful .apk reverse-engineering tools without that much wasting your time typing long paths to files.
- Speeds up the reverse-engineering process by offering shortcuts
